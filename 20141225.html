				<h2>History of TSA</h2>

				<div class="article-content">


    <p>The Technology Student Association (TSA) began in 1958 as the American Industrial Arts Student Association (AIASA), a student organization dedicated to students involved in technology education from kindergarten through high school. For the next twenty years, the American Industrial Arts Association sponsored activities of AIASA.</p>

    <p>In 1978, AIASA, Inc., a nonprofit organization formed to oversee AIASA activities. For the next decade, AIASA grew in size, strength, structure, and impact on students and secondary school programs.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of 1988, in its third decade, the AIASA changed the name of the organization to the Technology Student Association (TSA), the name by which it is known today. Since then, TSA has become the oldest and one of the largest student organizations in the country.</p>

    <p>For a more detailed and complete history of the Technology Student Association, visit the National TSA Website on its <a href="http://tsaweb.org/history" style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">history</a>.</p>

				<h2>Creed</h2>

				<div class="article-content">


                <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry.</p>

                <p>Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.</p>

                <p>I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living.</p>

                <p>I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals.</p>

                <p>I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God and my fellow Americans.</p>
